Hello Airship community,

My name is James Gu and I'd like to announce my candidacy for election to
the Airship Working Committee. I am currently employed by Insight Global.

My journey with Airship started in late 2018 when working for SUSE as a
product owner/technical lead. I led a team effort of enabling multi Linux
distro's in Airship, with the goal to expand Airship's user base.
Collaborating with the OpenStack community, the effort had spanned many
Airship projects (Treasuremap, Armada, Shipyard, Deckhand, etc.) as well as
OpenStack Helm project.

Prior to that, I had worked many years in technical leadership role in the
private cloud space, including workflow and orchestration, monitoring and
metering, HA and disaster recovery. Some work were directly contributed to
OpenStack, and other to proprietary technology.

At the end of 2019, I became involved in OPNFV Airship project and was elected
the PTL in Spring 2020. I work with both the CNTT (Cloud iNfrastructure
Telco Taskforce) and OPNFV community to develop Airship Installer as a
Reference Implementation of cloud and NFVi, and support the CNTT Reference
Conformance Testing and Certification. Some example work includes Treasuremap
1.8 integration in the CNTT OpenStack Reference implementation and investigating
the Airship 2.0 POC for CNTT Cloud Native Reference Architecture.

I am also involved in Airship 2.0 development when time allows.

If I am elected, I would like to act as the bridge between the CNTT, OPNFV and
Airship community. CNTT represents the collective voice of the telco
operators and vendors. I want to help to feed their requirements and use cases
into the Airship community timely and regularly, and influence the Airship 2 to
better aligned with the CNTT direction. Some examples include K8s conformance
certification and gating, bring your own baremetal/k8s use cases. On the other
hand, Airship is AFAIK the only cloud technology designed for telco, supporting
both cloud native and OpenStack, and managing from baremetal and up. I want to
continue to be an adamant advocate of Airship in the OPNFV and CNTT community,
hoping that Airship will have a positive impact on the CNTT's technology direction.
I would also want to ensure Airship 2.0 conform to the CNTT Cloud Native reference
architecture and implementation specs, and contribute to the CNTT conformance
certification and testing.


Thank you in advance for your consideration.


James Gu
