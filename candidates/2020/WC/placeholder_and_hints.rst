If you have never participated in an election and written up a nomination
before here are a few tips to help you:

* One purpose of the nomination text is to help the community to know you
  better and understand why you are running for the position
* Technical background and skills that you feel relevant for the position
  are good to mention
* Summarizing your involvement with the project will help to show what areas
  you are active in and what your experience is with the project and community
* Listing responsibilities you would take and actions you would drive will
  help the community to understand how you can fit into the WC group if you
  get elected
* There is no perfect nomination, make sure you include all talking points
  you would be interested to read in others'
* Don't forget to send the text to the airship-discuss mailing list as well
* For examples and inspiration you can look into the election candidacy folder
