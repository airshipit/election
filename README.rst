Airship Elections
=================

The Airship election repository provides a platform for election officials to
organize Airship elections as well as publicize historical election results,
election rules, and election procedures. We manage this repository in
accordance with the rules outlined in our `governance`_.

We encourage voicing questions about upcoming elections and the election
process in our `Slack workspace`_ or on our `mailing lists`_.

You can learn more about Airship on the `Airship wiki`_.
